
% use model to compute log likelihood
% data1=[1,219,4,1,360,294,66,1,411]

% log lik is slightly different than LL(end), since it is computed after the final M step
%loglik repesent the matching rate of data with hmm model(prior2,
%transmat2, obsmat2) the biger means match better£¬0 means the best

%path is the result of viterbi algorithm
% B = multinomial_prob(data1,obsmat2);
% path = viterbi_path(prior2, transmat2, obsmat2)
